          <p class="centered_text">I am a software developer with 2.3 years of experience in developing iOS and MacOS applications using Swift, SwiftUI, and Objective C. Additionally, I specialize in full-stack web development, creating exciting and interactive websites using HTML, CSS, and JS. My achievements include winning an award from Lecture Notes for developing a social networking website, and receiving recognition from Infosys Limited for my exceptional work in enhancing accessibility features in an iOS project, which earned me a prize and certificate.</p>

            <h3>iOS / MacOS Development</h3>
            <p>Over the last two and a half years, I have been serving as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys Limited, working on an iOS/macOS project. During my tenure, I have been proficiently utilizing native languages such as Swift, Swift UI, and Objective C to develop applications, troubleshoot issues, and ensure the accessibility of the applications.</p>

            <h3>Full Stack Web Development</h3>
            <p>In 2018, I began learning web development through an internship at Lecture Notes. During my time there, I developed a social networking website that was later awarded Best Project. My website creation process involves utilizing the MERN stack, which includes HTML, CSS, and ReactJS for frontend development and Node.JS and MongoDB for backend development. This approach allows me to create visually appealing and efficient websites. </p>

            <h3>Animated Picture Book</h3>
            <p>While I don't specialize in creating animated picture books, I do enjoy making them in my free time. I find creating animated picture books for young children to be a fun and fulfilling hobby. I believe that these picture books can help inspire creativity and encourage children to read. </p>
